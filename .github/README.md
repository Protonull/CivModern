# CivModern

This is a fork of CivModern specifically for [CivMC](https://civmc.net) on 1.21.1.

## Features

- Compacted items will have a configurably-coloured stack count.

- Ice-road macro (bound to `BACKSPACE` by default).

- Auto-attack macro (bound to `0` by default).

- Hold-key macro for the left mouse button (bound to `-` by default).

- Hold-key macro for the right mouse button (bound to `=` by default).

You may open CivModern's configuration screen in-game with the `R` binding. Or you can modify the config file directly,
which is located at `.minecraft/config/civmodern.properties`.

## Removed

- Radar has been removed. Why? Because it's duplicated effort. [CombatRadar](https://modrinth.com/mod/combatradar) and
  [CivVoxelMap](https://github.com/Protonull/CivVoxelMap) both provide radars that are legal on CivMC.

## Requirements

- Fabric Loader: `0.16.4` (or newer)
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api): `0.103.0+1.21.1` (or newer)

## Recommendations

- [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu): `11.0.2` (or newer)
